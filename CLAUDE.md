# Claude Guidelines

## Code Quality

### File Size Limits
- A single file should not exceed 300 lines of code
- If a file grows beyond 300 lines, refactor it into multiple files with focused responsibilities
- Extract cohesive functionality into dedicated services, utilities, or helper classes

### Responsibility Guidelines
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class should have one clear purpose
- Extract related functionality into domain-specific services
